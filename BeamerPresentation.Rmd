## Disease Ecology
Study of interactions among wildlife hosts, vectors, pathogens, and their environment  
- Prevalence?  
- What influences disease spillover?  
- When do outbreaks occur?  
- How does the environment influence interactions between hosts and pathogens?

## Plant-Insect-Pathogen Interactions

-Fire Blight - (Bacteria): Infects nectar secretion site in apples and pears, carried by bees  

-Mummy berry disease - (Fungus): Infects blueberry stems and wilted leaves become ‘pseudoflowers’ that attract insect visitors with ‘nectar’, UV, and scent  

-Crithidia & Nosema  spp. - (Trypanosome & Microsporidian): Infects bees through use of shared flowers, probably through feces, some plants may be better at harboring the diseases

##Research Questions
###Part I.
What is the prevalence of RNA viruses in bumble bees?  
Is there evidence for disease spillover from managed honey bees?  

###Part II. 
Can flowers act as bridges in disease transmission?

##Research Questions
###Part I.
What is the prevalence of RNA viruses in bumble bees?

-BQCV is most common, followed by DWV
    
Is there evidence for disease spillover from managed honey bees?

-Yes, bumble bees are more likely to be infected when caught near an apiary and when the apiary has high viral loads
    
###Part II.   
Can flowers act as bridges in disease transmission?

##Research Questions
###Part I.
What is the prevalence of RNA viruses in bumble bees?

-BQCV is most common, followed by DWV
    
Is there evidence for disease spillover from managed honey bees?

-Yes, bumble bees are more likely to be infected when caught near an apiary and when the apiary has high viral loads
    
###Part II. 
Can flowers act as bridges in disease transmission?

-Bees can deposit viruses on flowers

-Plant species and virus matter!

##Questions for future work...
-Can bees become infected after visiting an infected flower?  
-Are there differences in how viruses are shed?  
	 (Fecally vs. Orally)
-Does floral morphology matter?

##Implications

-BQCV is common in bumble bees and its effects should be studied  

-Reducing honey bee viral loads (mite management) could lessen spillover of DWV  


-Recommendations for  ‘pollinator friendly’ habitat
