## Nick Gotelli's Rant on Graduate student talks.

* Don't say:  'um' and 'uh'
* Too much mumbling and rushing
* Introductory material? 
  * Too much (EEB)
  * Too little (CMB)
* No uptalk! (raising voice at the end of a sentence)
* Don't ask for feedback, people will give it anyway.
* Questions during the talk are not good- it means that people are lost
* Make eye contact
* project your voice
* use the stage
* keep it short, never needs to be more than 40 minutes
* use lots of slides (40 min. talk = 100-120 slides (part of this is the sequential bullet points))
* use sequential bullet points 
* don't read slides
* Good graphics with large axes
* explain axis and units
* data and results should be clearly presented
* control lights and projector
* no laser pointer
* practicing and preparing:
  * outloud and standing up
  * videotape yourself
  * give the talk to the mirror
  * practice when you teach
