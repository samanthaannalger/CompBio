### `sample`
#### Samantha Alger

sample() will take a random sample of a specified size. You can specify whether to sample with or without replacement.

sample(x, size, replace =FALSE)

* x - object to be sampled
* size - size of the sample
* replace - should sampling be with replacement?

```{r}
#create an object to sample
x <- runif(1:10)

# take a sample of 100 from x
# without replacement (we will never find duplicates)
sample(x, 4, replace = FALSE)

# if you sample with replacement, you can sample at a size larger than the original object
#in this case, there will be numbers repeated
sample(x, 11, replace = TRUE)

```
