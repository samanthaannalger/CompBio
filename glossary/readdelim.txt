### `read.delim`
#### Samantha Alger

read.delim() is used to read in delimited text files, where data is organized in a data matrix with rows representing cases and columns representing variables.
read.delim(file,header=TRUE,sep="\t")

* file -A file location

* header - Whether the first line describes the column names

* sep - The table delimiter, often a tab (\t) or comma


```{r}
#The following is an example for how you would read in a .txt file.
#It is commented out since the .txt file does not exist

#d <-read.delim("annual.txt", header= TRUE, sep="\t")

```
