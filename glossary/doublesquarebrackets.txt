### `[[`

double brackets will return only a single element from a list. A single bracket will return you a list with as many elements.

```{r}
lst <- list('one','two','three')

a <- lst[1]
class(a)
## returns "list"


a <- lst[[1]]
class(a)
# returns "character"


#Example showing different uses with double and single brackets:
#Create a matrix
A = matrix(c(2,4,3,1,5,7),nrow=2,ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
print(A)

#Use double brackets to see the first element in the matrix
A[[1]]

#Use single brackets to see the entire first column
A[,1]
```
