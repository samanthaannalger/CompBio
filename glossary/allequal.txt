### `all.equal`
#### Samantha Alger

all.equal(target,current) will check if two objects are equal, or nearly equal.

* target-An R object
* current- A second R object to compare to target (the first argument)

Output will give the difference betwen the objects or will return TRUE if the values are sufficiently close enough

```{r}
all.equal(pi, 3.14)

all.equal(pi, 3.1415)

all.equal(pi, 3.141592)

all.equal(pi, 3.14159265)


```
