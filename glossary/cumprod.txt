### `cumprod`
#### Samantha Alger

cumprod() returns a vector with elements that are the cumulative products

```{r}
# create a vector consisting of 3 elements
x <-c(3,5,10)

# cumprod(x) will find the cumulative products
cumprod(x)

# the cumprod() function is doing the following calculations:
3 * 1
3 * 5
3*5*10
```
