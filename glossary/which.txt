### `which`
#### Samantha Alger

Use which() to find a subset of data that meet a particular criteria


```{r}
#Example 1:

#create a dataset
bird<- rep_len(c("finch","thrush","warbler"),20)

#use which to figure out the positions of a particular component
#of the dataset, which ones are "finch", which() returns the position.
which(bird =="finch")

# Another example:

#For a given vector, which is the index of the 3rd non-NA value?
#create dataset
x <- c(1,NA,2,NA,3)

#which position is the third non-NA value? 
which(!is.na(x))[3]
```
