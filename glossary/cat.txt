### `cat`
#### Samantha Alger
Print output to the screen or to a file. Use 'cat' instead of 'print' to print information from a function.
cat(..., file "", sep="",append=FALSE)

  * ... -The information to be printed to the screen or saved file
  
  * file- Specifies a file to be created (this is optional)
  
  * sep -Specifies what separates the objects in...that are to be printed.
  
  * append -If a file is specified, then indicate whether to append to the content in the existing file (the default is not to append, which means to overwrite the existing content).
  
```{r}

x <- c(1:10)
print(x)

# Space separator
cat(x)

# Multi-space separator, and adds a period between each number
cat(x, sep=" . ")

# Separates each number by a tab
cat(x, sep="\t")

# Separates each number by a line break
cat(x, sep="\n")

# Use cat to index particular values
# and specify how those values will be printed using sep

# creating a data set (y) of 10 random atomic components of either red or blue
y <- sample(c("red", "blue"), 10, TRUE)
y

# use cat to concatenate and print the two atomic components x and y
cat(x, y)

#use cat to specify which values to print (first value of each vector) and separate those two values by a tab.
cat(x[1], y[1], sep="\t")
```
