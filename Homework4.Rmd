# SAMPLING TIMES: 2017-08-18
# VARIABLE DESCRIPTION: Sample name is "RC"" for Ross Conrad and unique hive number. Target name is DWV (virus of interest), Ctmean, Ctsd, quantity mean, and quantity sd are from qPCR results. Run is the qPCR run #. dil. factor is the dilution of RNA used in PCR. genome copies is the target copies without reference gene. ACT genome copies is the reference genome copy number, norm genome copy is the normalized copies of DWV in each bee sample. Colony number is the unique ID given to each colony tested.
# MISSING DATA: Hive # 6 was not sampled
